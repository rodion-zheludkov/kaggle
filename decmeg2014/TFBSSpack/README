******************************* The TFBSS code *************************************

TFBSS performs Blind Source Separation of (over)determined multiplicative mixtures
of non-stationary real valued sources.

TFBSS can be downloaded at http://www.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/~fevotte/TFBSS_pack

TFBSS is based on the joint-diagonalization of whitened and noise-compensated
Spatial Time-Frequency Distribution (STFD) matrices of the observations,
corresponding to single auto-terms positions.

The current main reference  is:

A. Holobar, C. Févotte, C. Doncarli, and D. Zazula,
"Single autoterms selection for blind source separation in time-frequency plane",
In 11 e EUSIPCO, Toulouse, France, 3-6 septembre 2002.

The iterative selection of maxima of the criteria in the above paper has been 
replaced by a more simple and computation friendly gradient approach to be published
soon. The inner Iterative Joint Diagonalization has not been implemented in TFBSS.

The first paper dealing with joint-diagonalization of STFD matrices is:

A. Belouchrani and M. G. Amin,
"Blind Source Separation Based on Time-Frequency Signal Representation'',
IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing, vol. 46. No. 11. pp. 2888-2898. November 1998.
